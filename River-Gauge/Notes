How to do this
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sensors
-----------------------------------------------------------------
different options
    Ultrasonic sensor - may have trouble detecting turbid water
    photoelectric sensor - range may be too small
    camera - probably not realiable without image detection which sounds very difficult
    stick gauge - boring and can just use rocks, looking for realtime solution
    shaft encoders - not super realistic wayyyy too much infrastructure
    pressure gauges - lots of infrstructure, not cheap
    pressure sensor - its underwater, electronics would be wack,
    Radar sensors - seems reasonable, waves may bounce off water
    water flow sensor - only works with pipes? also underwater which is a pain

Ultrasonic sensors
Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves and measure the time it takes for the waves to bounce off the water surface and return. This data can be used to calculate the water level.

Pressure Transducers:
Pressure transducers are submerged in the water, and they measure the pressure exerted by the water column. From the pressure, you can calculate the water level.

Radar Sensors:
Radar sensors use microwave signals to determine the distance to the water surface. They are often more accurate and suitable for larger rivers.

Doppler Flow Meters:
Doppler flow meters measure the velocity of particles in the water, which can be used to estimate the volumetric flow rate.

Electromagnetic Flow Meters:
Electromagnetic flow meters are used to directly measure the flow rate of conductive fluids, making them suitable for accurate flow measurements.

Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP):
ADCPs are commonly used for measuring water flow in rivers and streams. They can provide velocity profiles at different depths, allowing for more accurate flow calculations.

Water Level Loggers:
Water level loggers continuously record water levels over time. They are usually paired with a pressure sensor and data logger for data collection.

Telemetry and Data logger:
You'll need a data logger to record sensor data and a telemetry system to transmit the data in real-time to a central server. This can be done using satellite, cellular, or radio 
communication.

Power Supply
Ensure you have a reliable power supply for your sensor and telemetry system. Solar panels with battery backup are often used in remote locations.

Data Processing and Visualization:
Set up a system for data processing, storage, and visualization. This could involve using a dedicated software system or a cloud-based solution.

Protection and Enclosure:
Your sensors, data logger, and telemetry equipment will need protective enclosures to shield them from the elements and ensure long-term operation.

Maintenance and Calibration:
Regular maintenance and calibration of your sensors are critical to ensure accurate and reliable data.

Currently Ultrasonic seems like the way to go

    Setup in trees or bridges or cliffs, slightly sheltered, above/away from the river, even if it was flooding, which gives some freedom for design shape and size. Should be able to be situated in an area with easy maintenance accessibility

Pros
    Cheap
    Non-contact
    Fairly easy and good setup
Cons
    Could malfunction if exposed to elements
    If water was too BROWN

Microcontroller
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely Arduino due to user documentation for hardware and software
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Power
Batteries
Powersupply connection
Solar Panel
Research but most likely just use batteries and potential upgrade to solar
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data Transmission
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Wired
Location for sensor is most likely too remote to have access to non-wireless modes of data transmission
Wireless
LoRwan
    seems complicated and maybe not long range enough
WIFI
    not long range enough for most locations that we want to put the sensor at
Bluetooth
    Too short range
    Possibility for arduino board w/ sensors that connects via bluetooth to a phone, which sends data
        much larger power consumption compared to using MKR 1400 or board w/ gsm/gprs shield
