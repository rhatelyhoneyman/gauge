    This website has a goal to map levels on remote rivers and classics that rely on a staff gauges to increase accessibility and reduce the gambling factor when making the rally. We are designing an affordable, adaptable gauge that has a minimal environmental impact while remaining functional.

    Stouts is a collection of those drops/rivers we have scouted from the road, the top of a canyon wall or even on alltrails. A collection to pull together first descents, shitty low volume drops, and massive stouts. Compiling info like estimated best level, time of year, previous descents, rough description, and pictures if they exist.
