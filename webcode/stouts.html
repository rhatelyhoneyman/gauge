<h3> Entry #1: The Cross River (upstream of its confluence with the Mitchell) </h3>
<img src="/images/crosslower1.PNG" style="width:20%;height:20%">
<br></br>
<p1>Scenic road to road put in and takeout. Runs off snowmelt late in the summer. Take the road towards nipika towards a quartz mine. Right before the mine there will be a bridge crossing the river with roads going up either side of the valley. The first is blown out and the second is narrow and scenic. We made it up with a Ford Focus but more clearance is nice. </p1>
<h3> Entry #2: Mitchell Canyon (First canyon on the Mitchell river referenced in Stewart Smith's guidebook)</h3>

<h3> Entry #4: Bobby burns falls</h3>
<img src="/images/bobbyburns1.jpg"style="width:20%">
<br></br>
<p1>20-30 footer that is typically done in the middle of a two day multiday down the Bobby Burns. It can be park and hucked by following some FSRs and bushwacking a bit. As we learned, 80 is a bit on the high side and 40 is ideal, using the Spillimacheen gauge.</p1>
